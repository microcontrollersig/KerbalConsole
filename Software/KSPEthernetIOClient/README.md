Wanted an app that could talk to KSP and report and change flight controls. 

Was originally going to use KSPEthernetIO, but couldn't get it to work.

Now using krpc from here: https://github.com/kylewill0725/krpc/releases

Just need the file called krpc_waffle_edition-0.4.9.2.zip

Works with KSP Version 1.10, said to also work for 1.8 and 1.9.
