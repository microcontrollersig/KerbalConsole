# Building the Client

The client is written in python using the PyQt5 library and a packager called fbs (https://build-system.fman.io/)

The GUI portion was designed using QT Creator

# Prerequisites

Need to install Python 3.6.8

# Extra Notes

The **Buttons** directory contains the user-interface design built in QT Creator. For FBS to work, if these files are modified, these files need to be copied to src/main/resources/windows (where windows is the OS)
